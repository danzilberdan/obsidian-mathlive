# Obsidian MathLive
Edit Latex math formulas visually in Obsidian.

## Usage
1. When creating new math content, an *Edit in MathLive* action is used to start creating the math visually.
1. Editing existing math content is also supported by selecting math content and using the *Edit in MathLive* action.

## Recommended Setup
It is recommended to assign a hot key in order to quickly open up the visual editor.

## MathLive
[MathLive](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/) is a web component for math content input.

## Future Plans
Obsidian MathLive currently uses a Modal that contains the math editor. ideally, the plugin should be implemented as an [Editor Extension](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs/editor/extensions).
